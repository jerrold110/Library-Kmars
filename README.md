# Introduction
This is an implementation of K-means/medians/medoids with various distance metrics (including Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine...).

I created this library for my own use, out of frustratation that the KMeans class of the Scikit-learn library lacks options for customising the variant of the K-algorithm and options for using distance metrics besides Euclidean distance. This library was developed with the intention to replicate the functionality and API convention used in Scikit-learn so that end users, such as myself, will have little difficulty writing code for K-algorithm clustering machine learning tasks.
